THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION. </p>
        <p>SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

THE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW. </p>
        <p>THE SERVICES ARE CONTROLLED AND OPERATED FROM FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES. KONVIV MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS THAT THE SERVICES ARE APPROPRIATE OR AVAILABLE FOR USE IN OTHER LOCATIONS. THOSE WHO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS DO SO AT THEIR OWN VOLITION AND ARE ENTIRELY RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE UNITED STATES AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO EXPORT AND IMPORT REGULATIONS.

        <p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Konviv and its subsidiaries, agents, licensors, managers, and other affiliated companies, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to the Services, including any data or content transmitted or received by you; (ii) your violation of any term of these Terms, including without limitation your breach of any of the representations and warranties above; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any right of privacy or intellectual property rights; (iv) your violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation; (v) User Content or any content that is submitted via your account including without limitation misleading, false, or inaccurate information; (vi) your willful misconduct; or (vii) any other party's access and use of the Services with your unique username, password or other appropriate security code.</p>
        <p class= "one_tab">D. <span class="underline">Assignment</span></p>
        <p>You may not transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder or your Konviv Account in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without our prior written consent.  Any transfer, assignment, or delegation of these Terms that you make shall be null and void from the initial date thereof.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations hereunder without your consent.</p>
        <p class = "one_tab">E. <span class="underline">Third-Party Beneficiary</span></p>
        <p>You agree that our third-party services providers are third-party beneficiaries of the applicable provisions of these Terms, with all rights to enforce such provisions as if such service providers were a party to these Terms. </p>
        <p class = "one_tab">F. <span class="underline">Governing Law/Jurisdiction</span></p>
        <p>These Terms are made under and will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.</p>
        <p>The provider of services is set forth herein. If you are a California resident, in accordance with Cal. Civ. Code &sect1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112 Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210 or (916) 445-1254. </p>
        <p>Further, you and Konviv agree to the jurisdiction of the federal Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Services or these Terms (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section XII(G) of these Terms.</p>
        <p class="one_tab">G. <span class="underline">ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</span></p>
        <p class="two_tab">1. <span class="underline">Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration</span></p>
        <p class ="one_tab">You and Konviv agree that any and all controversies, disputes, demands, claims, or causes of action between you and Konviv (including the interpretation and scope of this Section and the arbitrability of the controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action) relating in any way to the Services (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms) or these Terms (as well as any related or prior agreement between you and Konviv), will be determined and  resolved exclusively through binding and confidential arbitration. The arbitration will take place in San Francisco, California, unless you and Konviv otherwise agree in writing.  As used in this Section, <q>we</q>, <q>us</q>, or <q>Konviv</q> mean Konviv and its subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, and assigns and all of its and their respective employees, officers, directors, agents, and representatives. In addition, <q>we</q>, <q>us</q>, or <q>Konviv</q> include any third party providing any product, service, or benefit in connection with the Services or these Terms (as well as any related or prior agreement that you may have had with us) if such third party is named as a co-party with us in any controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action subject to this Section. </p>
        <p class ="one_tab">Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.  You should review this Arbitration Agreement carefully. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you are GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights.  Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT A JUDGE OR JURY. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures may be SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrators' decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT. </p>
        <p class="two_tab">2. <span class= "underline">Exceptions</span></p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the section above (XII(G)(1)), you and Konviv both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (a) bring an individual action in a U.S. small claims court or (b) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.  In addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn't stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa). </p>
        <p class="two_tab">3. <span class="underline">Notice; Process</span></p>
        <p class ="one_tab">A Party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (the <q><span class="underline">Notice</span></q>).  Konviv's address for Notice is:  Konviv, Inc., Attn:  Legal, 2150 Shattuck Avenue, Penthouse, Berkeley, CA 94704.  The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (the <q><span class="underline">Demand</span></q>).  We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Konviv may commence an arbitration proceeding.  During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Konviv shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.    All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator's decision and award shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.  </p>
        <p class="two_tab">4. <span class="underline">Arbitration Rules</span></p>
        <p class ="one_tab">Arbitration will be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The arbitration will be conducted before one commercial arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association (<q><span class="underline">AAA</span></q>) with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes. As modified by these Terms, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the <q><span class="underline">Rules and Procedures</span></q>). </p>
        <p class ="one_tab">The following rules apply: </p>
        <p class= "two_tab">a) In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation; </p>
        <p class="two_tab">b) We also reserve the right, in our sole and exclusive discretion, to assume responsibility for any or all of the costs of the arbitration;  </p>
        <p class="two_tab">c) The arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law;</p>
        <p class="two_tab">d) The arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by applicable law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; </p>
        <p class="two_tab">e) Subject to the limitation of liability provisions of these Terms, the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are expressly permitted by applicable law; and </p>
        <p class="two_tab">f) Each party will pay its own attorneys' fees and expenses, unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses and the arbitrator awards such attorneys' fees and expenses to the prevailing party, and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded will be determined by the applicable law. </p>

        <p class="two_tab">5. <span class="underline">NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDINGS:  CLASS ACTION WAIVER</span></p>
        <p class ="one_tab">YOU AND KONVIV AGREE THAT ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR US MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. UNLESS YOU AND KONVIV AGREE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF. </p>
        <p class = "two_tab">6. <span class="underline">Survivability and Severability of Arbitration Agreement</span></p>
        <p class ="one_tab">This Arbitration Agreement will survive termination of your Konviv Account and these Terms as well as any voluntary payment of any debt in full by you or any bankruptcy by you or us. With the exception of subpart(5)(G) of this Section (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision will remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal, or conflicting part was not contained herein. If, however, subpart (5)(G) of this Section is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will be null and void, and neither you nor we will be entitled to arbitration, and you and we agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section XII(F) shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to these Terms.   </p>
        <p class="two_tab">H. <span class="underline">Waiver</span></p>
        <p>The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein will not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.  To be effective, any waiver with regards to these Terms must be in writing and any such waiver shall apply only to the matter or instance specifically waived.   </p>
        <p class = "two_tab">I. <span class="underline">Severability</span></p>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. </p>
        <p class= "two_tab">J. <span class="underline">Headings</span></p>
        <p>You and Konviv agree that the headings of each Section of these Terms are for reference only and in no way affect the interpretation of this Agreement.</p>
        <p class="two_tab">K. <span class="underline">Entire Agreement</span></p>
        <p>These Terms, together with our <a class="priv_pol_link" href="https://Konviv.github.io/docs">Privacy Policy</a>, constitute the entire and sole agreement between you and us with respect to the Services and supersede all prior understandings, arrangements, or agreements, whether written or oral, regarding the Services.  </p>
